# Multilingual-semantic-search
This project implements a semantic search engine for the English translation of Mahabharata Tatparya Nirnaya, a revered commentary on the Mahabharata by Sri Madhvacharya.

The goal is to help readers find contextually relevant passages from the text. Traditional keyword-based search often falls short when dealing with spiritual or philosophical literature. Thatâ€™s where semantic search becomes valuable.

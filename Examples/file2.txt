Krishna advises Arjuna to perform his duty.
Meditation calms the restless mind.
नैव किञ्चित्करोमीति युक्तो मन्येत तत्ववित्।
Karma Yoga teaches selfless action performed without desire for rewards.
The supreme reality is beyond name and form.
He who has conquered himself is greater than he who conquers a thousand men in battle.
When meditation is mastered, the mind is unwavering like the flame of a lamp in a windless place.
Perform your duty without attachment
He who has conquered the mind is at peace
The soul is eternal, indestructible
Be equal in pleasure and pain
He who renounces the fruits of action is wise

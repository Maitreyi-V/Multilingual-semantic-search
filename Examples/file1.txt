Bhagavad Gita teaches karma yoga.
Detachment is the way to peace.
The wise man performs his duty without attachment to results.
One who sees inaction in action is truly wise.
Yoga is the journey of the self, through the self, to the self.
The soul is eternal; it neither kills nor can be killed.
Renunciation is not the mere abandoning of action, but detachment from the fruits of action.
